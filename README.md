# RockPaperScissors
iOS Study Project

#### This application has been prepared as the final project of the Oxford Swift Language Course.

#### This application uses UIKit elements such as "Label", "Button".
### Also, to work with pseudo-random numbers, the library was imported *GameplayKit* using such a tool like GKRandomDistribution.

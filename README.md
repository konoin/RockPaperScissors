# RockPaperScissors
iOS Study Project

## This application has been prepared as the final project of the Oxford Swift Language Course.

## This application uses UIKit elements such as "Label", "Button".
### Also, to work with pseudo-random numbers, the library was imported *GameplayKit* using such a tool like GKRandomDistribution.

you can win, play in a draw or lose.
